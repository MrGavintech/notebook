This app uses Session storage to store user notes. It uses angular material for a simple layout, and simple state management using basic RxJS w/out the use of any 3rd party state managers. This was a timed/quick project I did for an interview requirement. The primary requirement was to allow note-taking on the initial page displayed. Also, the requirement said it shouldn't duplicate the users' notes upon navigation to the same app in a new tab, or lose data in any tab on refreshes. It was limited to 5 notes.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files.
