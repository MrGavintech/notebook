# Notebook

This app uses Session storage to store user notes, angular material for a quick layout, and a basic structure to allow for a simple state management w/out the use of any 3rd party libraries. This was just a sample project I did for an interview requirement. The project was timed, so I always feel like there's room for improvement on a timed exercise. 

## What could be better and worked as issue requests?
When time permits, these are the following items I'd like to address in the code base
* More robust state manager such as redux or simpler like Dan's observable store
* Clean up linting issues and remove inline lint comments
* Add unit tests with JEST or similar
* Change UI theme and add a more robust UX
* Remove some unnecessary classes and folders from structure
* Refactor some of the code for a simpler implementation


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files.
